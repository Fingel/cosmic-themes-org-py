# cosmic-themes.org
This is the sourcecode for [cosmic-themes.org](https://cosmic-themes.org). No, it is not written in Rust (yet).

Note that for now, a binary built from [cosmic-theme-tools](https://github.com/Fingel/cosmic-theme-tools) must be
available somewhere on the $PATH to successfully parse .ron files.

Todo:

1. Rewrite entire site in Rust
2. Add more themes
3. Add sorting/filtering, if ever necessary
